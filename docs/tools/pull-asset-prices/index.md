# Overview

**Pull Asset Prices** is a handy tool for Google Sheets that makes it super easy to track live prices for Stocks, Crypto, Gold, and Silver. Just drop in the tickers you want, and it’ll automatically pull in the latest prices for you.

You can use those price values anywhere in your sheet — or even link them up in other spreadsheets. Simple as that!

## Step 1 - Enter your tickers

Add your Stock and Crypto tickers to the green columns.

## Step 2 - Pull the prices now

Prices update automatically every hour, but you can pull prices **now** anytime from the menu.

The results from the price update are displayed for transparency and troubleshooting (if needed).
