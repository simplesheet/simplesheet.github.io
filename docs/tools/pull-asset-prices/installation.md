# Installation

> How do I install this thing?

### Installation Overview

The **Pull Asset Prices** tool is written in the _Google Script programming language_ (essentially JavaScript) and runs using Google's `Apps Script` platform. You will copy and paste a script into the Apps Script area of your spreadsheet, authorize it to run, then use it! ðŸ¤‘ 

The tool will automatically build the required spreadsheet tab used for entering in your tickers.


## Installation Considerations

This tool can be installed in a brand-new spreadsheet _OR_ in an existing spreadsheet where you are already tracking your assets.

I suggest installing the tool in a single location (rather than multiple spreadsheets) and then plugging the asset-prices in where ever you need them. The asset-prices can be accessed from the same spreadsheet where the **Pull Asset Prices** tool is installed AND from any other spreadsheet you own. 

**Installing and using this tool from a single-spreadsheet means you only need to update your asset tickers in one location.**

That being said, it's up to you how you would like to use it! So do your thing ðŸ˜Ž

# Installation Steps

First things first. Open an existing Google Sheet or create a new Sheet where you would like to install the tool.

---

## Step 2 - Rename the 'Apps Script' Project

Give the project a name so it's something better than "Untitled project" ðŸ˜’

Change the name to **Pull Asset Prices**

## Step 3 - Copy the script

Open the <a href="https://github.com/simplesheet/pull-asset-prices/blob/main/pull_asset_prices.gs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**Script Source**</a> page on Github and use the **Copy raw file** button to copy the script.

Script source URL: <a href="https://github.com/simplesheet/pull-asset-prices/blob/main/pull_asset_prices.gs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/simplesheet/pull-asset-prices/blob/main/pull_asset_prices.gs</a>

## Step 4 - Paste the script

Now that you have the script copied to your clipboard from the previous step, it's time to paste it into your Apps Script project.

Navigate back to the App Scripts project, remove the existing code, then paste the script code.

## Step 5 - Save and Initialize the tool

Click the **Save** button then click **Run** to initialized the tool

---

## Step 6 - Review and Authorize app permissions

As with any app or add-on, Google requires your authorization to run the code.

The `Google hasn't verified this app` screen looks kinda scary ðŸ˜± but you can safely proceed. Check out the [Script Safety]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tools/pull-asset-prices/safety.html) page for more information.

### Authorization Steps

1. Click `Review permissions`
2. Choose your google account that owns the spreadsheet
3. Click `Advanced` then `Go to Pull Asset Prices (unsafe)`
4. Select all of the access scopes then click `Continue`

The app initialization will now proceed...

## Step 7 - All done! ðŸŽ‰

Phew! That was pretty Simple... right? ðŸ˜…

The app is now initialized. You won't need to mess with Apps Script anymore.

You'll see a new **Asset Prices** tab on your spreadsheet.

1. Close the **Apps Scripts** browser tab
2. Then refresh your spreadsheet browser tab to see a new menu item appear: **Pull Asset Prices**

The menu option will now appear everytime you open the spreadsheet.
